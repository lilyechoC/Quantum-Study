This is a paper for the things we need to pay attention when running programs on IBM's quantum computer cloud service. Because of the hardware structure, we need to make some changes to the CNOT gates sometimes, and this paper is a guidance to that. My note is a mathematical proof of why we can makes such changes to the circuits.
